 [ Project ID: 102 ] : Gesture based text creation aka Virtual Notepad and recognition
 
week1- the content of week1 contains basic python ,datasciene libraries like numpy,pandas and matplotlib and intro to ml the assignment was some problems based on the same things which are mentioned in the content 
we were supposed to do the assignment in jupyternotebook or google colab and upload them in github and submit their link.

week-2: in week 2 the theory was given and link to utube videos about nueral networks and the taks were given to understand cnn , tensorflow basics for cnn , overfitting and underfitting,how to save a trained model and load a pretrained model and the assignment was based on activations relu,sigmoid,tanh and simple mlp some tasks were also given

week-3: this week the content was about relu,Transfer Learning, Data Augmentation, Famous architectures : Inception, ResNets, VGG. and the tasks were data Augmentation : Tensorflow Implementation ,
Transfer Learning :Cat-Dog Classifier using InceptionV3. and coming to the assignment it contains 4 parts part 1 ist to Make a CNN architecture and train it for CIFAR100 classification and plot the necessary graphs,part-2 is to Load a pre-trained model (either VGG16 or VGG19 or InceptionV3 and Check its accuracy using weights of imagnet dataset only on CIFAR10 dataset, in part-3  we should Make Pneumonia or Normal classifier based on Chest X-Ray and part-4 is to use a CNN architecture on fashion-mnist and compare accuracy with MLP models.

week-4:various small small details of mediapipe and OpenCV explained in the video given in the content .there wasno assignment.

week-5: the assignment is to make a brightness controller,drag and drop a saved image ,Pause the screen whenever 4 or more fingers are detected these should be done using hand gestures.

week-6: this is our final project VirtualNotepad  which contains a canvas. 9 header images were given to draw on the canvas using handgestures by selecting the coloured brushes and u can also erase it using the eraser , u can predict the numbers drawn by tapping on predict button the mnistmodel is used for this. u can also change the volume and brightness of the system using handgestures by tapping on the volume and brightness icons .
